This is ported from the original Direct Test Mode example provided by Nordic.
Some of the modifications include:
1) Add simple_uart functionality to give feedback to the user
2) Increase wait time between the first and the 2nd byte.  The original one
provides very small time between the first and 2nd byte entered.

This project works with Nordic 51422 eval board.
