Dec 6, 2016.  Project to put RF into Test mode.
WARNING: To successfully use this project, pin HM1 must be pulled down to 0 at
boot up.  That is, you can't manually change the HM1 to 0 through SW because
by the time the software is running, the BOOT mode has already been decided.

HM0 should be 0 also, but this is the default.
